# JVM languages

Small example projects, with multiple implementations in JVM-based languages:

* [Java 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/java8-2100321.html)
* [Groovy](http://groovy-lang.org/)
* [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
* [Scala](http://scala-lang.org/)
* [Xtend](http://xtend-lang.org/)

The project ideas are listed in the [wiki](https://github.com/szarnyasg/jvm-languages/wiki).

## Resources

* Our comparison of [JVM-based languages](https://github.com/FTSRG/cheat-sheets/wiki/JVM-based-languages)
* [Google Trends](https://www.google.com/trends/explore?q=%2Fm%2F02js86,%2Fm%2F0_lcrx4,%2Fm%2F091hdj)
  * Note that Xtend is difficult to search, as you will get a lot of food supplements.
  * Basically, in popularity for searches, Java beats every language here by almost 2 orders of magnitude.
