# JVM languages

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/szarnyasg/rosetta-beans.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/szarnyasg/rosetta-beans)

Small example projects, with multiple implementations in JVM-based languages:

* [Java 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/java8-2100321.html)
* [Groovy](http://groovy-lang.org/)
* [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
* [Scala](http://scala-lang.org/)
* [Clojure](https://clojure.org/)

The project ideas are listed in the [wiki](https://github.com/szarnyasg/rosetta-beans/wiki).

## History

Previously the project included the [Xtend](http://xtend-lang.org/) language, but it was removed due to the lack of recent developments.
